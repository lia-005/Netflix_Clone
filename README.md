# Netflix UI Clone 🎬

Welcome to my **Netflix UI Clone** project! This is a simple web-based clone of the Netflix homepage created using **HTML** and **CSS**. It's designed to give you the feel of the real Netflix site but without any actual functionality like login or video playing. This is just the design (UI).

## 📁 Project Structure

The project has three main parts:

1. **index.html**
   - This is the main webpage file.
   - It contains all the content and layout of the Netflix homepage like headers, featured sections, movie cards, and the footer.

2. **style.css**
   - This file controls the styling of the webpage.
   - It makes the page look nice by adding colors, spacing, layout designs, fonts, and responsiveness.

3. **assets/** folder
   - This folder contains all the images and logos used in the project.
   - It includes Netflix logos, background images, thumbnails, and icons.
